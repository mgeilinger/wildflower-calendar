        <p>This wildflower calendar aims to be a useful tool for enthusiasts, botanists, and nature lovers who want to keep track of when different wildflowers bloom throughout the year.</p>
        <p>It is organised on a monthly basis. This gives you an idea of what to look out for at different times of the year. Due to the infrequency and overlap of flower blooming times in the later part of the year, I have combined August and September, as well as October with November and December.</p>
        <p>Plants are listed in alphabetical order in the month which they appear. This is not necessarily the peak in their flowering season. January is an exception because it includes plants which flower all year round.</p>
        <p>Each flower can be clicked on to take you to its relevant Wikipedia page.</p>
